LSH
===

LSH is a simple implementation of a shell in C.  It demonstrates the basics of
how a shell works.  That is: read, parse, fork, exec, and wait.  So I think it's
pretty cool.  Since it's a simple implementation, it has some limitations.

* Commands must be on a single line.
* Arguments must be separated by whitespace.
* No quoting arguments or escaping whitespace.
* No piping or redirection.
* Only builtins are: `cd`, `help`, `exit`.
